# Technical Test: React & TypeScript

This technical test is for a European company offering an annual salary of €55,000. The objective is to create an application similar to the one provided in this [example](https://midu-react-11.surge.sh/), using the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/).

## Objectives

Build a web application using React and TypeScript that:

1. [✅] Fetches **100 rows of data** using the Random User API.
2. [✅] Displays the data in a **table format**, similar to the provided example.
3. Implements the following features:
   - [✅] **Row Highlighting:** Allow users to color table rows as demonstrated.
   - [✅] **Sorting by Country:** Enable sorting by the country column via column headers.
   - [✅] **Delete Row:** Allow users to delete individual rows.
   - [✅] **Restore Initial State:** Provide an option to restore the initial state, recovering all deleted rows.
   - [✅] **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle any potential errors during API requests.
   - [✅] **Filter by Country:** Let users filter the table data by country without resorting the table.
4. [✅] Ensure that **filtering by country** does not reset the table's current sort order.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
